This repository includes codes for the "Breast Cancer Detections in Mammograms" project.

CertainAI Inference.ipynb:

This is the code that makes the predictions using the previously trained models. It combines many different models with an algorithm that gives the best possible F1 score.

CertainAI Preprocessing.ipynb:

This is the code that preprocesses DICOM images. It resizes them, windows them, and saves them as PNG files.

CertainAI Training Task 1.ipynb:

This is the training code that trains models to detect the BI-RADS score.

CertainAI Training Task 2.ipynb:

This is the training code that trains models to detect densities of breasts.

CertainAI Training Task 3.ipynb:

This is the training code that trains models to detect quadrants of cancerous findings.
